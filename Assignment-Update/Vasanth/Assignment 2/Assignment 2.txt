				 ASSIGNMENT 2


Build a python code, assume you get temperature and humidity values (generated with random 
function to a variable) and write a condition to continuously detect alarm in case of high 
temperature.

Code:
import time
from random import randint
while randint:
    humidity=randint(0,100)+1
    temperature=randint(-100,100)+1
    if humidity>50:
        print("\n \n Humidity is High")
        print(humidity)
    if temperature>50:
       print("Temperature is High")
       print(temperature)
    time.sleep(1)  

Output:
Humidity is High
101
Temperature is High
96
Humidity is High
75
Humidity is High
57
Temperature is High
88
Humidity is High
70
Temperature is High
70
Humidity is High
65
Humidity is High
73
Temperature is High
98
Humidity is High
78
Humidity is High
79
Humidity is High
75
